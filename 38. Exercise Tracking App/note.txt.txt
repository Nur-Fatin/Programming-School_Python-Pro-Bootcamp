__________Day 38/Goal: Build Exercise Tracking App__________
Project link: https://replit.com/@Nur-Fatin/Exercise-Tracking-App

What the software does?
Track the amount of time and calories burn during exercise 
How it works?
1. Ask user what exercise they did, include the duration.
Then, Log the data inside spreadsheet
If they give in unit like KM, change that into duration

#####################################################################################################################
What it needs to have?
1. Google spreadsheet
2. Nutrition & Exercise API with natural language functionality.
 Turn spoken text into precise nutrition analysis (https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api)
3. A service to Turn my Google spreadsheet into an API,
So I can make http request. add data to the spreadsheet programmatically.

What I need the computer to do? 
    What's the first thing I need to happen?
    How? What's the fastest way?
    Think about user experience: how to fasten up the process of using the software.

1. Setup Nutritionix API Credentials and Google Spreadsheet

2. Get Exercise Stats with Natural Language Queries using Nutritionix API:
> This API will enrich the exercise info that I give as an input
> It will estimate calories burned using natural language as input
Get input from user: input("Tell me what exercise you did: ")

3. Set up Your Google Sheet with Sheety. Create a new project via my Google spreadsheet link.
Sheety turns my spreadsheet -> Restful JSON API. So, I can add/change the data programmatically

4. Saving Exercise Data into Google Sheets, include the current time.
means create a new row in sheet.

5. Authenticate Your Sheety API
    > create token in sheety
    > add token to header variable in json format
    > update the request to include headers

6. Environment Variables in Repl.it.
    > Before I can upload my app into Repl.it,
    I need to store my all sensitive data inside environment variables
    import os

     1. create a .env file in Repl.it to store the Environment Variables.

     2. set the environment variables
        APP_ID = os.environ["APP_ID"]
        API_KEY = os.environ["API_KEY"]

     3. get the environment variables and use the value inside my program
        APP_ID = os.environ.get("APP_ID")
        API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")

Concept 1: turn Google spreadsheet into API endpoints with the authentication
Why important : Save data in spreadsheet automatically

Concept 2: natural language functionality in API
Why important : Enrich existing data
